# Showcases of Different ML Algorithms

### Using Background Color Classification

This is a Kotlin application that experiments with different machine learning algorithms to recommend a light/dark font against different background colors. 

Some algorithms are built completely from scratch but others are showcased using a library. 

The current algorithms/library implementations: 

- Formulaic
- Linear regression (w/ hill climbing)
- Logistic regression (w/ hill climbing)
- Neural Network (w/ hill climbing)
- Neural Network (w/ simulated annealing)
- OjAlgo Neural Network 
- DL4J Neural Network 

Planned to be added: 

- Linear regression (w/ gradient descent)
- Logistic regression (w/ gradient descent)
- Random forest/decision tree
- Continuous Naive Bayes
- SMILE linear regression
- SMILE logistic regression
- SMILE decision trees/random forests
